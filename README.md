# Keras-Practice

Spent 5 hours on keras and AAPL stock data Today; been working on the improved version of this Binance crypto trading bot for almost a week.
I still have a lot of work and commenting to do over the weekend. I have a midterm tomorrow so that's it for today.
Up till now, I imported and processed the data and trained an 8 layer neural network for 500 epochs with 5000 days of AAPL stock data.

The neural network outputs one of 3 options for the close price of the current day; up, sideways, or down. (buy, hold, sell)
